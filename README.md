Four Seasons
===
"Four Seasons" is a piece of digital painting that will be draw by the nature,representing the four seasons of 2013.

We use the Arduino platform to sense everyday humidity and temperature, transform the data to color values,

then create a css 'brush' to draw the painting on a webpage.

The painting will start from 4th Fab 2013, the first day of spring base on the Chinese calendar,

and the final result depends on the whether of the year,

therefore it will be a co-creation of nature and technology.



An Arduino Project just for fun.

Created by @ruohanc -the hacker and @jinglevol -the artist.
